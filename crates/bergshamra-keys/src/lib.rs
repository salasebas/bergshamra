//! Key management for the Bergshamra XML Security library.
//!
//! Supports loading keys from PEM, DER, PKCS#8, PKCS#12, and raw binary formats.
//! Provides a `KeysManager` for named key lookup and a `KeyInfo` XML processor.
//!
//! ## Shared infrastructure
//!
//! Trust store management, certificate chain building/verification, and
//! cryptographic algorithm support are re-exported from the shared [`tsp_ltv`]
//! crate. This follows the same "thin facade" pattern used by underskrift
//! (PDF signing library).
